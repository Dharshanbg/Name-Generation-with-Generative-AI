# Name-Generation-with-Generative-AI


This repository contains an implementation of a name generator based on a decoder-based transformer architecture. The generator creates new names based on a dataset of existing names. It does not utilize the PyTorch module, providing a lightweight solution for understanding transformer internals.

Prerequisites
